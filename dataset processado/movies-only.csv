Gerard Depardieu plays a crude but charismatic thief, whose own gayness does not prevent his commiserating with those of the opposite sex. Miou-Miou and Michel Blanc are young, impoverished lovers who fall under Depardieu's influence. He gains their confidence by introducing them to kinky sex, then sucks them into a vortex of crime. Director Bertrand Blier, who in most of his films has explored the awesome power (rather than pleasure) of sex, nearly outdoes himself in Menage (aka Tenue de Soiree).","[{'id': 80, 'name': 'Crime'}, {'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 35, 'name': 'Comedy'}]",84.0,1986-04-23,/cwSg1tPiGVip3EksfE1EHWciJFC.jpg

118,Otello,"Having previously staged Verdi's 1887 opera Otello at the Met and La Scala, filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli committed his production to film in 1986. Starring as the fatally jealous Moor of Venice is Placido Domingo, who had also headlined Zeffirelli's 1976 La Scala staging (production on the film was briefly interrupted while Domingo participated in the rescue operations following the Mexico City earthquake). While Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino Diaz as Iago perform their own singing, Zeffirelli's Cassio--played by real-life European prince Urbano Barberini--is dubbed by Ezio de Cesare. The director made several cuts in the original libretto and score in order to accommodate the film's two-hour time limit, but these excisions are done with taste and discretion. Because of the excessive violence in the third act--two murders, a suicide, a superficial throat-slashing--Otello was released with a PG rating.","[{'id': 28, 'name': 'Action'}, {'id': 12, 'name': 'Adventure'}, {'id': 80, 'name': 'Crime'}, {'id': 9648, 'name': 'Mystery'}, {'id': 53, 'name': 'Thriller'}]",0.0,1986-12-17,/pPHMSeOVR2BVq32JP7bgcLqlSf4.jpg

6121,Ziggy  Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,"Documentary from David Bowie's concert at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on 3 July 1973, when he performed as alter ego Ziggy Stardust for the very last time.  The quintessential moment in glam-rock history, ZIGGY STARDUST AND THE SPIDERS FROM MARS is David Bowie at his best. This film of the 1973 concert (released 10 years later) documents the hallucinogenic collage of kitsch, Warhol/Pop irony, and flamboyant excess that was the Bowie phenomenon: his trademark synthetic androgyny is a musical symbiosis of feminine passion and masculine dominance that define his funky, gender-bending art and, ultimately, the glam-rock genre as a whole. Early on, the film cuts to elaborate backstage costume changes between sets, highlighting a playlist that includes such classics as ""Changes,"" ""Space Oddity,"" ""Time,"" and ""Suffragette City.""","[{'id': 99, 'name': 'Documentary'}, {'id': 10402, 'name': 'Music'}]",90.0,1973-12-23,/1bVRQIEy5mCRztQlPs6a9yUdW67.jpg

They say that they are happily married - unlike their friends Katarina and Peter who openly fight, especially when under the influence of alcohol - but there is a certain detached aloofness in the way they treat each other. In the next ten years, as they contemplate or embark upon divorce and/or known extramarital affairs, they come to differing understandings at each phase of their relationship of what they truly mean to each other. Regardless of if it's love or hate - between which there is a fine line - they also come to certain understandings of how they can best relate to each other, whether that be as husband and wife, friends, lovers or none of the above.","[{'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 10749, 'name': 'Romance'}]",283.0,1973-04-11,/nr87dK7xn8qeJiwYoL2DVJ9WhTm.jpg

Starting from their mid-60's garage band roots (sounding amazingly like the Sonics), the Motor City 5 deveoped into an icon for a brand of loud, crushing music reflecting their industrial roots. Even if you don't care for their music (and you're bound to like even a few of their songs), their story is fascinating. It combines 60's protest, youthful braggadocio, and a style of music that would help carry one to the likes of Iggy and the Stooges (not to mention certain aspects of punk rock). This film is clearly a labor of love, combining extraordinarily rare live shows, still shots, a nearly-continuous backdrop of MC5 tunes, penetrating interviews with the remaining members and their spouses, and even FBI surveillance shots.
